# Quick Reference: How to See ALL and RIGHT AND LEFT Quadrants

## üéØ The Problem
You keep getting Protocol 10, which only has FRONT and BACK quadrants.

## ‚úÖ The Solution
You need brain maps with specific indices that route to different protocols.

## üìä Quick Lookup Chart

### For ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, or SLEEP Conditions:

| Brain Map Index | Protocol Assigned | Quadrants You'll See |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **4, 8, 11, 14, 16, 23** | **Protocol 12** | ‚úì ALL + RIGHT AND LEFT |
| 1, 2, 7, 9, 15, 22, 24 | Protocol 11 | ‚úì ALL only |
| 3, 5, 6, 10, 12, 13, 17-21 | Protocol 10 | ‚úó Only FRONT/BACK |

### For OCD, CHRONIC PAIN, SPECTRUM, HEADACHE, STROKE, or ADDICTIONS:

| Brain Map Index | Protocol Assigned | Quadrants You'll See |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 24** | **Protocol 6** | ‚úì ALL + RIGHT AND LEFT |
| 1, 6, 8, 12, 14, 23 | Protocol 5 | ‚úì ALL only |
| 3, 10, 13, 15-22 | Protocol 4 | ‚úó Only FRONT/BACK |

### For HEAD INJURY, PEAK PERFORMANCE, or CHRONIC FATIGUE:

| Brain Map Index | Protocol Assigned | Quadrants You'll See |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **2, 4, 5, 9, 11, 24** | **Protocol 9** | ‚úì ALL + RIGHT AND LEFT |
| 1, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 23 | Protocol 8 | ‚úì ALL only |
| 3, 10, 13, 15-22 | Protocol 7 | ‚úó Only FRONT/BACK |

### For MEMORY or FOCUS:

| Brain Map Index | Protocol Assigned | Quadrants You'll See |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **1, 8, 11, 12, 23** | **Protocol 3** | ‚úì ALL + RIGHT AND LEFT |
| 2, 4, 7, 9, 14, 24 | Protocol 2 | ‚úì ALL only |
| 3, 5, 6, 10, 13, 15-22 | Protocol 1 | ‚úó Only FRONT/BACK |

## üîç How to Check Your Current Brain Map

1. Open browser console (F12 or right-click ‚Üí Inspect)
2. Upload your brain map and analyze it
3. Look for these console messages:

```
üìã handleViewProtocol called with:
  nr_protocol_id: 10  ‚Üê Your protocol number
  
üîç ProtocolModal1070 - Steps received:
  steps: [
    { step: 1, quadrant: "FRONT", ... }  ‚Üê Quadrant types
    { step: 2, quadrant: "BACK", ... }
    ...
  ]
```

## üí° Testing Recommendations

### Best Test Cases (Most Likely to Show ALL + RIGHT AND LEFT):

1. **ANXIETY + Index 4** ‚Üí Protocol 12
2. **DEPRESSION + Index 8** ‚Üí Protocol 12  
3. **OCD + Index 2** ‚Üí Protocol 6
4. **MEMORY + Index 1** ‚Üí Protocol 3
5. **HEAD INJURY + Index 4** ‚Üí Protocol 9

### If You Don't Have These Brain Maps:

Check your existing brain maps' indices using the console logs, then reference this chart to see what quadrants that protocol should have.

## üìù All 12 Protocols - Quadrant Summary

| Protocol | Frequency | Cycles | Has ALL? | Has RIGHT AND LEFT? |
|----------|-----------|--------|----------|-------------------|
| Protocol 1 | 40Hz | 1 | ‚úó | ‚úó |
| Protocol 2 | 40Hz | 2 | ‚úì | ‚úó |
| Protocol 3 | 40Hz | 1 | ‚úì | ‚úì |
| Protocol 4 | 10Hz | 1 | ‚úó | ‚úó |
| Protocol 5 | 10Hz | 2 | ‚úì | ‚úó |
| Protocol 6 | 10Hz | 1 | ‚úì | ‚úì |
| Protocol 7 | 20Hz | 1 | ‚úó | ‚úó |
| Protocol 8 | 20Hz | 2 | ‚úì | ‚úó |
| Protocol 9 | 20Hz | 1 | ‚úì | ‚úì |
| Protocol 10 | 1Hz | 1 | ‚úó | ‚úó |
| Protocol 11 | 1Hz | 2 | ‚úì | ‚úó |
| Protocol 12 | 1Hz | 1 | ‚úì | ‚úì |

**Protocols with only FRONT/BACK:** 1, 4, 7, 10
**Protocols with ALL:** 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12
**Protocols with RIGHT AND LEFT:** 3, 6, 9, 12

## ‚ö° Quick Action

**To see ALL and RIGHT AND LEFT quadrants right now:**

1. Find a brain map with one of these indices: **1, 2, 4, 8, 11, or 23**
2. Select condition: **ANXIETY** or **DEPRESSION** or **SLEEP**
3. Upload and analyze
4. You should get Protocol 11 or 12 (both have ALL, Protocol 12 also has RIGHT AND LEFT)

## üìû Still Not Seeing Them?

Check console logs:
- If `nr_protocol_id` shows 10, 7, 4, or 1 ‚Üí These protocols don't have ALL/RIGHT AND LEFT
- If `nr_protocol_id` shows 12, 11, 9, 8, 6, 5, 3, or 2 ‚Üí Should have special quadrants
- If console shows correct protocol but modal doesn't ‚Üí File a bug report
